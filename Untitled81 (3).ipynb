    "Q1. **Hierarchical Clustering**:\n",
    "   Hierarchical clustering is a method that creates a tree-like structure of clusters, known as a dendrogram.\n",
    "   It differs from other clustering techniques by forming a hierarchy of nested clusters rather \n",
    "   than requiring a predefined number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Two Main Types of Hierarchical Clustering**:\n",
    "   - **Agglomerative Clustering**: Starts with individual data points as clusters and merges \n",
    "       them into larger clusters iteratively.\n",
    "   - **Divisive Clustering**: Begins with one cluster containing all data points and recursively splits it into\n",
    "       smaller clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Determining Distance Between Clusters**:\n",
    "   The distance between clusters can be determined using various distance metrics,\n",
    "    such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, cosine similarity, and others, depending on the data type and \n",
    "    characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Finding Optimal Number of Clusters**:\n",
    "   Methods for determining the optimal number of clusters in hierarchical clustering include visual \n",
    "   inspection of dendrograms and techniques like cutting the dendrogram at a certain height, using \n",
    "   the cophenetic correlation coefficient, and comparing clustering solutions using cluster validation indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Dendrograms**:\n",
    "   Dendrograms are tree-like diagrams that display the hierarchical relationships between clusters. \n",
    "  They are useful for visualizing cluster structure and helping analysts make decisions about the number of clusters to select.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Hierarchical Clustering for Different Data Types**:\n",
    "   Hierarchical clustering can be used for both numerical and categorical data. \n",
    "   For numerical data, common distance metrics like Euclidean or Manhattan distance are used.\n",
    "   For categorical data, metrics like the Jaccard coefficient or Gower's distance are employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Using Hierarchical Clustering for Identifying Outliers**:\n",
    "   Hierarchical clustering can identify outliers by examining clusters with small numbers of data points or\n",
    "   clusters that are distant from other clusters in the dendrogram. Points in such clusters may be considered \n",
    "   outliers or anomalies."
